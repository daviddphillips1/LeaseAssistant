# LeaseAssistant
Simple python script/app to fill in a .docx based template using data from a .xlsx workbook.

Was tasked by a family friend to help automate some of their mundane office tasks. Using this script, any .docx template using formatted "{{variable_name}}" 
indentifiers and a corresponding .xlsx workbook that contains those same variable names+data will be used together 
to create a .docx and pdf file with the data inserted in the correct locations. 

The workbook must be formatted in the same manner as the included example. The program also utilizes a simple GUI made with tk.
